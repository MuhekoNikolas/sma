{"uniqueId":6,"title":"The Deserted Garden","textContent":"I know a village in a far-off land\nWhere from a sunny, mountain-girdled plain\nWith tinted walls a space on either hand\nAnd fed by many an olive-darkened lane\nThe high-road mounts, and thence a silver band\nThrough vineyard slopes above and rolling grain,\nWinds off to that dim corner of the skies\nWhere behind sunset hills a stately city lies.\n\nHere, among trees whose overhanging shade\nStrews petals on the little droves below,\nPattering townward in the morning weighed\nWith greens from many an upland garden-row,\nRuns an old wall; long centuries have frayed\nIts scalloped edge, and passers to and fro\nHeard never from beyond its crumbling height\nSweet laughter ring at noon or plaintive song at night.\n\nBut here where little lizards bask and blink\nThe tendrils of the trumpet-vine have run,\nAt whose red bells the humming bird to drink\nStops oft before his garden feast is done;\nAnd rose-geraniums, with that tender pink\nThat cloud-banks borrow from the setting sun,\nHave covered part of this old wall, entwined\nWith fair plumbago, blue as evening heavens behind.\n\nAnd crowning other parts the wild white rose\nRivals the honey-suckle with the bees.\nAbove the old abandoned orchard shows\nAnd all within beneath the dense-set trees,\nTall and luxuriant the rank grass grows,\nThat settled in its wavy depth one sees\nGrass melt in leaves, the mossy trunks between,\nDown fading avenues of implicated green;\n\nWherein no lack of flowers the verdurous night\nWith stars and pearly nebula o'erlay;\nAzalea-boughs half rosy and half white\nShine through the green and clustering apple-spray,\nSuch as the fairy-queen before her knight\nWaved in old story, luring him away\nWhere round lost isles Hesperian billows break\nOr towers loom up beneath the clear, translucent lake;\n\nAnd under the deep grass blue hare-bells hide,\nAnd myrtle plots with dew-fall ever wet,\nGay tiger-lilies flammulate and pied,\nSometime on pathway borders neatly set,\nNow blossom through the brake on either side,\nWhere heliotrope and weedy mignonette,\nWith vines in bloom and flower-bearing trees,\nMingle their incense all to swell the perfumed breeze,\n\nThat sprung like Hermes from his natal cave\nIn some blue rampart of the curving West,\nComes up the valleys where green cornfields wave,\nRavels the cloud about the mountain crest,\nBreathes on the lake till gentle ripples pave\nIts placid floor; at length a long-loved guest,\nHe steals across this plot of pleasant ground,\nWaking the vocal leaves to a sweet vernal sound.\n\nHere many a day right gladly have I sped,\nContent amid the wavy plumes to lie,\nAnd through the woven branches overhead\nWatch the white, ever-wandering clouds go by,\nAnd soaring birds make their dissolving bed\nFar in the azure depths of summer sky,\nOr nearer that small huntsman of the air,\nThe fly-catcher, dart nimbly from his leafy lair;\n\nPillowed at case to hear the merry tune\nOf mating warblers in the boughs above\nAnd shrill cicadas whom the hottest noon\nKeeps not from drowsy song; the mourning dove\nPours down the murmuring grove his plaintive croon\nThat like the voice of visionary love\nOft have I risen to seek through this green maze\n(Even as my feet thread now the great world's garden-ways);\n\nAnd, parting tangled bushes as I passed\nDown beechen allies beautiful and dim,\nPerhaps by some deep-shaded pool at last\nMy feet would pause, where goldfish poise and swim,\nAnd snowy callas' velvet cups are massed\nAround the mossy, fern-encircled brim.\nHere, then, that magic summoning would cease,\nOr sound far off again among the orchard trees.\n\nAnd here where the blanched lilies of the vale\nAnd violets and yellow star-flowers teem,\nAnd pink and purple hyacinths exhale\nTheir heavy fume, once more to drowse and dream\nMy head would sink, from many an olden tale\nDrawing imagination's fervid theme,\nOr haply peopling this enchanting spot\nOnly with fair creations of fantastic thought.\n\nFor oft I think, in years long since gone by,\nThat gentle hearts dwelt here and gentle hands\nStored all this bowery bliss to beautify\nThe paradise of some unsung romance;\nHere, safe from all except the loved one's eye,\n'Tis sweet to think white limbs were wont to glance,\nWell pleased to wanton like the flowers and share\nTheir simple loveliness with the enamored air.\n\nThrice dear to them whose votive fingers decked\nThe altars of First Love were these green ways,\nThese lawns and verdurous brakes forever flecked\nWith the warm sunshine of midsummer days;\nOft where the long straight allies intersect\nAnd marble seats surround the open space,\nWhere a tiled pool and sculptured fountain stand,\nHath Evening found them seated, silent, hand in hand.\n\nWhen twilight deepened, in the gathering shade\nBeneath that old titanic cypress row,\nWhose sombre vault and towering colonnade\nDwarfed the enfolded forms that moved below,\nOft with close steps these happy lovers strayed,\nTill down its darkening aisle the sunset glow\nGrew less and patterning the garden floor\nFaint flakes of filtering moonlight mantled more and more.\n\nAnd the strange tempest that a touch imparts\nThrough the mid fibre of the molten frame,\nWhen the sweet flesh in early youth asserts\nIts heyday verve and little hints enflame,\nDisturbed them as they walked; from their full hearts\nWelled the soft word, and many a tender name\nStrove on their lips as breast to breast they strained\nAnd the deep joy they drank seemed never, never drained.\n\nLove's soul that is the depth of starry skies\nSet in the splendor of one upturned face\nTo beam adorably through half-closed eyes;\nLove's body where the breadth of summer days\nAnd all the beauty earth and air comprise\nCome to the compass of an arm's embrace,\nTo burn a moment on impassioned lips\nAnd yield intemperate joy to quivering finger-tips,\n\nThey knew; and here where morning-glories cling\nRound carven forms of carefullest artifice,\nThey made a bower where every outward thing\nShould comment on the cause of their own bliss;\nWith flowers of liveliest hue encompassing\nThat flower that the beloved body is\nThat rose that for the banquet of Love's bee\nHas budded all the æons of past eternity.\n\nBut their choice seat was where the garden wall,\nCrowning a little summit, far and near,\nLooks over tufted treetops onto all\nThe pleasant outer country; rising here\nFrom rustling foliage where cuckoos call\nOn summer evenings, stands a belvedere,\nBuff-hued, of antique plaster, overrun\nWith flowering vines and weatherworn by rain and sun.\n\nStill round the turrets of this antique tower\nThe bougainvillea hangs a crimson crown,\nWistaria-vines and clematis in flower,\nWreathing the lower surface further down,\nHide the old plaster in a very shower\nOf motley blossoms like a broidered gown.\nOutside, ascending from the garden grove,\nA crumbling stairway winds to the one room above.\n\nAnd whoso mounts by this dismantled stair\nFinds the old pleasure-hall, long disarrayed,\nBrick-tiled and raftered, and the walls foursquare\nRinged all about with a twofold arcade.\nBackward dense branches intercept the glare\nOf afternoon with eucalyptus shade;\nEastward the level valley-plains expand,\nSweet as a queen's survey of her own Fairyland.\n\nFor through that frame the ivied arches make,\nWide tracts of sunny midland charm the eye,\nFrequent with hamlet grove, and lucent lake\nWhere the blue hills' inverted contours lie;\nFar to the east where billowy mountains break\nIn surf of snow against a sapphire sky,\nHuge thunderheads loom up behind the ranges,\nChanging from gold to pink as deepening sunset changes;\n\nAnd over plain and far sierra spread\nThe fulgent rays of fading afternoon,\nShowing each utmost peak and watershed\nAll clarified, each tassel and festoon\nOf floating cloud embroidered overhead,\nLike lotus-leaves on bluest waters strewn,\nFlushing with rose, while all breathes fresh and free\nIn peace and amplitude and bland tranquillity.\n\nDear were such evenings to this gentle pair;\nLove's tide that launched on with a blast too strong\nSweeps toward the foaming reef, the hidden snare,\nBaffling with fond illusion's siren-song,\nToo faint, on idle shoals, to linger there\nFar from Youth's glowing dream, bore them along,\nWith purple sail and steered by seraph hands\nTo isles resplendent in the sunset of romance.\n\nAnd out of this old house a flowery fane,\nA bridal bower, a pearly pleasure-dome,\nThey built, and furnished it with gold and grain,\nAnd bade all spirits of beauty hither come,\nAnd wingéd Love to enter with his train\nAnd bless their pillow, and in this his home\nMake them his priests as Hero was of yore\nIn her sweet girlhood by the blue Dardanian shore.\n\nTree-ferns, therefore, and potted palms they brought,\nTripods and urns in rare and curious taste,\nPolychrome chests and cabinets inwrought\nWith pearl and ivory etched and interlaced;\nPendant brocades with massive braid were caught,\nAnd chain-slung, oriental lamps so placed\nTo light the lounger on some low divan,\nSunken in swelling down and silks from Hindustan.\n\nAnd there was spread, upon the ample floors,\nWork of the Levantine's laborious loom,\nSuch as by Euxine or Ionian shores\nCarpets the dim seraglio's scented gloom.\nEach morn renewed, the garden's flowery stores\nBlushed in fair vases, ochre and peach-bloom,\nAnd little birds through wicker doors left wide\nFlew in to trill a space from the green world outside.\n\nAnd there was many a dainty attitude,\nBronze and eburnean. All but disarrayed,\nHere in eternal doubt sweet Psyche stood\nFain of the bath's delight, yet still afraid\nLest aught in that palatial solitude\nLurked of most menace to a helpless maid.\nTherefore forever faltering she stands,\nNor yet the last loose fold slips rippling from her hands.\n\nClose by upon a beryl column, clad\nIn the fresh flower of adolescent grace,\nThey set the dear Bithynian shepherd lad,\nThe nude Antinous. That gentle face,\nForever beautiful, forever sad,\nShows but one aspect, moon-like, to our gaze,\nYet Fancy pictures how those lips could smile\nAt revelries in Rome, and banquets on the Nile.\n\nAnd there were shapes of Beauty myriads more,\nClustering their rosy bridal bed around,\nWhose scented breadth a silken fabric wore\nBroidered with peacock hues on creamiest ground,\nFit to have graced the barge that Cydnus bore\nOr Venus' bed in her enchanted mound,\nWhile pillows swelled in stuffs of Orient dyes,\nAll broidered with strange fruits and birds of Paradise.\n\n'Twas such a bower as Youth has visions of,\nThither with one fair spirit to retire,\nLie upon rose-leaves, sleep and wake with Love\nAnd feast on kisses to the heart's desire;\nWhere by a casement opening on a grove,\nWide to the wood-winds and the sweet birds' choir,\nA girl might stand and gaze into green boughs,\nLike Credhe at the window of her golden house.\n\nOr most like Vivien, the enchanting fay,\nWhere with her friend, in the strange tower they planned,\nShe lies and dreams eternity away,\nAbove the treetops in Broceliande,\nSometimes at twilight when the woods are gray\nAnd wolf-packs howl far out across the lande,\nWaking to love, while up behind the trees\nThe large midsummer moon lifts-even so loved these.\n\nFor here, their pleasure was to come and sit\nOft when the sun sloped midway to the west,\nWatching with sweet enjoyment interknit\nThe long light slant across the green earth's breast,\nAnd clouds upon the ranges opposite,\nRolled up into a gleaming thundercrest,\nTopple and break and fall in purple rain,\nAnd mist of summer showers trail out across the plain.\n\nWhereon the shafts of ardent light, far-flung\nAcross the luminous azure overhead,\nOfttimes in arcs of transient beauty hung\nThe fragmentary rainbow's green and red.\nJoy it was here to love and to be young,\nTo watch the sun sink to his western bed,\nAnd streaming back out of their flaming core\nThe vesperal aurora's glorious banners soar.\n\nTinging each altitude of heaven in turn,\nThose fiery rays would sweep. The cumuli\nThat peeped above the mountain-tops would burn\nCarmine a space; the cirrus-whorls on high,\nMore delicate than sprays of maiden fern,\nStreak with pale rose the peacock-breasted sky,\nThen blanch. As water-lilies fold at night,\nSank back into themselves those plumes of fervid light.\n\nAnd they would watch the first faint stars appear,\nThe blue East blend with the blue hills below,\nAs lovers when their shuddering bliss draws near\nInto one pulse of fluid rapture grow.\nNew fragrance on the freshening atmosphere\nWould steal with evening, and the sunset glow\nDraw deeper down into the wondrous west\nRound vales of Proserpine and islands of the blest.\n\nSo dusk would come and mingle lake and shore,\nThe snow-peaks fade to frosty, opaline,\nTo pearl the doméd clouds the mountains bore,\nWhere late the sun's effulgent fire had been\nShowing as darkness deepened more and more\nThe incandescent lightnings flare within,\nAnd Night that furls the lily in the glen\nAnd twines impatient arms would fall, and then---and then . . .\n\nSometimes the peasant, coming late from town\nWith empty panniers on his little drove\nPast the old lookout when the Northern Crown\nGlittered with Cygnus through the scented grove,\nWould hear soft noise of lute-strings wafted down\nAnd voices singing through the leaves above\nThose songs that well from the warm heart that woos\nAt balconies in Merida or Vera Cruz.\n\nAnd he would pause under the garden wall,\nCaught in the spell of that voluptuous strain,\nWith all the sultry South in it, and all\nIts importunity of love and pain;\nAnd he would wait till the last passionate fall\nDied on the night, and all was still again.\nThen to his upland village wander home,\nMarvelling whence that flood of elfin song might come.\n\nO lyre that Love's white holy hands caress,\nYouth, from thy bosom welled their passionate lays\nSweet opportunity for happiness\nSo brief, so passing beautiful---O days,\nWhen to the heart's divine indulgences\nAll earth in smiling ministration pays\nThine was the source whose plenitude, past over,\nWhat prize shall rest to pluck, what secret to discover!\n\nThe wake of color that follows her when May\nWalks on the hills loose-haired and daisy-crowned,\nThe deep horizons of a summer's day,\nFair cities, and the pleasures that abound\nWhere music calls, and crowds in bright array\nGather by night to find and to be found;\nWhat were these worth or all delightful things\nWithout thine eyes to read their true interpretings!\n\nFor thee the mountains open glorious gates,\nTo thee white arms put out from orient skies,\nEarth, like a jewelled bride for one she waits,\nDecks but to be delicious in thine eyes,\nThou guest of honor for one day, whose fêtes\nEternity has travailed to devise;\nAh, grace them well in the brief hour they last!\nAnother's turn prepares, another follows fast.\n\nYet not without one fond memorial\nLet my sun set who found the world so fair!\nFrail verse, when Time the singer's coronal\nHas rent, and stripped the rose-leaves from his hair,\nBe thou my tablet on the temple wall!\nAmong the pious testimonials there,\nWitness how sweetly on my heart as well\nThe miracles of dawn and starry evening fell!\n\nSpeak of one then who had the lust to feel,\nAnd, from the hues that far horizons take,\nAnd cloud and sunset, drank the wild appeal,\nToo deep to live for aught but life's sweet sake,\nWhose only motive was the will to kneel\nWhere Beauty's purest benediction spake,\nWho only coveted what grove and field\nAnd sunshine and green Earth and tender arms could yield---\n\nA nympholept, through pleasant days and drear\nSeeking his faultless adolescent dream,\nA pilgrim down the paths that disappear\nIn mist and rainbows on the world's extreme,\nA helpless voyager who all too near\nThe mouth of Life's fair flower-bordered stream,\nClutched at Love's single respite in his need\nMore than the drowning swimmer clutches at a reed---\n\nThat coming one whose feet in other days\nShall bleed like mine for ever having, more\nThan any purpose, felt the need to praise\nAnd seek the angelic image to adore,\nIn love with Love, its wonderful, sweet ways\nCounting what most makes life worth living for,\nThat so some relic may be his to see\nHow I loved these things too and they were dear to me.\n\nI sometimes think a conscious happiness\nMantles through all the rose's sentient vine\nWhen summer winds with myriad calyces\nOf bloom its clambering height incarnadine;\nI sometimes think that cleaving lips, no less,\nAnd limbs that crowned desires at length entwine\nAre nerves through which that being drinks delight,\nWhose frame is the green Earth robed round with day and night.\n\nAnd such were theirs: the traveller without,\nPausing at night under the orchard trees,\nWondered and crossed himself in holy doubt,\nFor through their song and in the murmuring breeze\nIt seemed angelic choirs were all about\nMingling in universal harmonies,\nAs though, responsive to the chords they woke,\nAll Nature into sweet epithalamium broke.\n\nAnd still they think a spirit haunts the place:\n'Tis said, when Night has drawn her jewelled pall\nAnd through the branches twinkling fireflies trace\nTheir mimic constellations, if it fall\nThat one should see the moon rise through the lace\nOf blossomy boughs above the garden wall,\nThat surely would he take great ill thereof\nAnd famish in a fit of unexpressive love.\n\nBut this I know not, for what time the wain\nWas loosened and the lily's petal furled,\nThen I would rise, climb the old wall again,\nAnd pausing look forth on the sundown world,\nScan the wide reaches of the wondrous plain,\nThe hamlet sites where settling smoke lay curled,\nThe poplar-bordered roads, and far away\nFair snowpeaks colored with the sun's last ray.\n\nWaves of faint sound would pulsate from afar\nFaint song and preludes of the summer night;\nDeep in the cloudless west the evening star\nHung 'twixt the orange and the emerald light;\nFrom the dark vale where shades crepuscular\nDimmed the old grove-girt belfry glimmering white,\nThrobbing, as

sweet meand'rings flow,\nMild as the murmurs of the Bird of Woe;\nWho gave to Sympathy its softest pow'r,\nThe charm to wing Affliction's sable hour;\nWho in Italia's groves, with thrilling song,\nCall'd mute attention from the minstrel throng;\nGave proud distinction to the Poet's name,\nAnd claim'd, by modest worth, the wreath of fame­\nAccept the Verse thy magic harp inspires,\nNor

from the sun-shine of poetic fame,\nStripp'd of each charm she scarcely boasts a name:\nHer voice no more can please the vapid throng,\nNo more loud Pæans consecrate her song,\nCold, faint, and sullen, to the grove she flies,\nA faded garland veils her radiant eyes:\nA with'ring laurel on her breast she wears,\nFann'd by her sighs, and spangled with her tears;\nFrom her each fond associate early fled,\nShe mourn'd a MILTON lost, a SHAKSPERE dead:\nHer eye beheld a CHATTERTON oppress'd,\nA famish'd OTWAY­ravish'd from her breast;\nNow in their place a flutt'ring form appears,\nMocks her fall'n pow'r, and triumphs in her tears:\nA flippant, senseless, aëry thing, whose eye\nGlares wanton mirth, and fulsome ribaldry.\n\nWhile motley mumm'ry holds her tinsel reign,\nSHAKSPERE might

that wings its shaft at Fame,\nOr gives to pamper'd Vice a pompous Name;\nThen, calm reflection shuns the sordid crowd,\nThe senseless chaos of the little proud,\nThen, indignation stealing through the breast,\nSpurns the pert tribe in flimsy greatness drest;\nWho, to their native nothingness consign'd,\nSink in contempt­nor leave a trace behind.\nThen Fancy paints, in visionary gloom,\nThe sainted shadows of the laurel'd tomb,\nThe Star of Virtue glist'ning on each breast,\nDivine insignia of the spirit blest!\nThen MILTON smiles serene, a beauteous shade,\nIn worth august­in lust'rous fires array'd.\nImmortal SHAKSPERE gleams across the sight,\nRob'd in ethereal vest of radiant light.\nWing'd Ages picture to the dazzled view\nEach mark'd perfection­of the sacred few,\nPOPE, DRYDEN, SPENSER, all that Fame shall raise,\nFrom CHAUCER'S gloom­till MERRY'S lucid days:\nThen emulation kindles fancy's fire,\nThe glorious throng poetic flights inspire;\nEach sensate bosom feels the god-like flame,\nThe cherish'd harbinger of future fame.\nYet timid genius, oft in conscious ease,\nSteals from the world, content the few to please:\nObscur'd in shades, the modest Muse retires,\nWhile sparkling vapours emulate her fires.\nThe proud enthusiast shuns promiscuous praise,\nThe Idiot's smile condemns the Poet's lays.\nPerfection wisely courts the lib'ral few,\nThe voice of kindred genius must be true.\nBut empty witlings sate the public eye\nWith puny jest and low buffoonery,\nThe buzzing hornets swarm about the great,\nThe poor appendages of pamper'd state;\nThe trifling, flutt'ring insects of a day,\nFlit near the sun, and glitter in its ray;\nWhose subtle fires with charms magnetic burn,\nWhere every servile fool may have his turn.\nLull'd in the lap of indolence, they boast\nWho best can fawn­and who can flatter most;\nWhile with a cunning arrogance they blend\nSound without sense­and wit that stabs a friend;\nSlanders oblique­that check ambition's toil,\nThe pois'nous weeds, that mark the barren soil.\nSo the sweet blossoms of salubrious spring\nThro the lone wood their spicy odours fling;\nShrink from the sun, and bow their beauteous heads\nTo scatter incense o'er their native beds,\nWhile coarser flow'rs expand with gaudy ray,\nBrave the rude wind, and mock the burning day.\n\nAh! gentle Muse, from trivial follies turn,\nWhere Patriot souls with god-like passions burn;\nAgain to MERRY dedicate the line,\nSo shall the envied boast of taste be thine;\nSo shall thy song to glorious themes aspire,\n\"Warm'd with a spark\" of his

mind.\nThe god-like fervour, thrilling thro' the heart,\nGives new creation to each vital part;\nThrobs rapture thro' each palpitating vein,\nWings the rapt thought, and warms the fertile brain;\nTo her the noblest attributes of Heav'n,\nAmbition, valour, eloquence, are giv'n.\nShe binds the soldier's brow with wreaths sublime,\nFrom her, expanding reason learns to climb,\nTo her the sounds of melody belong,\nShe wakes the raptures of the Poet's song;\n'Tis god-like Freedom bids each passion live,\nThat truth may boast, or patriot virtue give;\nFrom her, the Arts enlighten'd splendours own,\nShe guides the peasant­She adorns the throne;\nTo mild Philanthropy extends her hand,\nGives Truth pre-eminence, and Worth command;\nHer eye directs the path that leads to Fame,\nLights Valour's torch, and trims the glorious flame;\nShe scatters joy o'er Nature's endless scope,\nGives strength to Reason­extacy to Hope;\nTempers each pang Humanity can feel,\nAnd binds presumptuous Power with nerves of steel;\nStrangles each tyrant Phantom in its birth,\nAnd knows no title­but SUPERIOR WORTH.\n\nEnlighten'd Gallia! what were all your toys,\nYour dazzling splendours­your voluptuous joys

restrain,\nAnd lead the victim in a flow'ry chain:\nCold Superstition favour'd the deceit,\nAnd e'en Religion lent her aid to cheat,­\nWhen warlike LOUIS, I arrogant and vain,\nWhom worth could never

I\n\nWhat were the feelings of the hapless throng,\nBy threats insulted, and oppress'd with wrong ?\nWhile grasping avarice, with skill profound,\nSpread her fell snares, and dealt destruction round;\nEach rising sun some new infringement saw,\nWhile pride was consequence­and pow'r was law;\nA people's suff'rings hop'd redress in vain,\nSubjection curb'd the tongue that dar'd complain.\nImputed guilt each virtuous victim led\nWhere all the fiends their direst mischiefs spread;\nWhere, thro' long ages past, with watchful care,\nTHY TYRANTS, GALLIA, nurs'd the witch DESPAIR.\nWhere in her black BASTILE the harpy fed\nOn the warm crimson drops, her fangs had shed;\nWhere recreant malice mock'd the suff'rer's sigh,\nWhile regal lightnings darted from her

lies!­\nThe angel, PITY, now each cave explores,\nBraves the chill damps, and fells the pond'rous doors,\nPlucks from the flinty walls the clanking chains,\nWhere many a dreadful tale of woe

{"uniqueId":23,"title":"The Widow's Home","textContent":"Close on the margin of a brawling brook\nThat bathes the low dell's bosom, stands a Cot;\nO'ershadow'd by broad Alders. At its door\nA rude seat, with an ozier canopy\nInvites the weary traveller to rest.\n'Tis a poor humble dwelling; yet within,\nThe sweets of joy domestic, oft have made\nThe long hour not unchearly, while the Moor\nWas covered with deep snow, and the bleak blast\nSwept with impetuous wing the mountain's brow!\nOn ev'ry tree of the near shelt'ring wood\nThe minstrelsy of Nature, shrill and wild,\nWelcomes the stranger guest, and carolling\nLove-songs, spontaneous, greets him merrily.\nThe distant hills, empurpled by the dawn\nAnd thinly scatter'd with blue mists that float\nOn their bleak summits dimly visible,\nSkirt the domain luxuriant, while the air\nBreathes healthful fragrance. On the Cottage roof\nThe gadding Ivy, and the tawny Vine\nBind the brown thatch, the shelter'd winter-hut\nOf the tame Sparrow, and the Red-breast bold.\n\nThere dwells the Soldier's Widow! young and fair\nYet not more fair than virtuous. Every day\nShe wastes the hour-glass, waiting his return,--\nAnd every hour anticipates the day,\n(Deceiv'd, yet cherish'd by the flatt'rer hope)\nWhen she shall meet her Hero. On the Eve\nOf Sabbath rest, she trims her little hut\nWith blossoms, fresh and gaudy, still, herself\nThe queen-flow'r of the garland ! The sweet Rose\nOf wood-wild beauty, blushing thro' her tears.\n\nOne little Son she has, a lusty Boy,\nThe darling of her guiltless, mourning heart,\nThe only dear and gay associate\nOf her lone widowhood. His sun-burnt cheek\nIs never blanch'd with fear, though he will climb\nThe broad oak's branches, and with brawny arm\nSever the limpid wave. In his blue eye\nBeams all his mother's gentleness of soul;\nWhile his brave father's warm intrepid heart\nThrobs in his infant bosom. 'Tis a wight\nMost valourous, yet pliant as the stem\nOf the low vale-born lily, when the dew\nPresses its perfum'd head. Eight years his voice\nHas chear'd the homely hut, for he could lisp\nSoft words of filial fondness, ere his feet\nCould measure the smooth path-way.\nOn the hills\nHe watches the wide waste of wavy green\nTissued with orient lustre, till his eyes\nAche with the dazzling splendour, and the main,\nRolling and blazing, seems a second Sun !\nAnd, if a distant whitening sail appears,\nSkimming the bright horizon while the mast\nIs canopied with clouds of dappled gold,\nHe homeward hastes rejoicing. An old Tree\nIs his lone watch-tow'r; 'tis a blasted Oak\nWhich, from a vagrant Acorn, ages past,\nSprang up, to triumph like a Savage bold\nBraving the Season's warfare. There he sits\nSilent and musing the long Evening hour,\n'Till the short reign of Sunny splendour fades\nAt the cold touch of twilight. Oft he sings;\nOr from his oaten pipe, untiring pours\nThe tune mellifluous which his father sung,\nWhen HE could only listen.\nOn the sands\nThat bind the level sea-shore, will he stray,\nWhen morn unlocks the East, and flings afar\nThe rosy day-beam ! There the boy will stop\nTo gather the dank weeds which ocean leaves\nOn the bleak strand, while winter o'er the main\nHowls its nocturnal clamour. There again\nHe chaunts his Father's ditty. Never more\nPoor mountain minstrel, shall thy bosom throb\nTo the sweet cadence ! never more thy tear\nFall as the dulcet breathings give each word\nExpression magical ! Thy Father, Boy,\nSleeps on the bed of death ! His tongue is mute,\nHis fingers have forgot their pliant art,\nHis oaten pipe will ne'er again be heard\nEchoing along the valley ! Never more\nWill thy fond mother meet the balmy smile\nOf peace domestic, or the circling arm\nOf valour, temper'd by the milder joys\nOf rural merriment. His very name\nIs now forgotten! for no trophied tomb\nTells of his bold exploits; such heraldry\nBefits not humble worth: For pomp and praise\nWait in the gilded palaces of Pride\nTo dress Ambition's Slaves. Yet, on his grave,\nThe unmark'd resting place of Valour's Sons,\nThe morning beam shines lust'rous; The meek flow'r\nStill drops the twilight tear, and the night breeze\nMoans melancholy music!\nThen, to ME,\nO ! dearer far is the poor Soldier's grave,\nThe Widow's lone and unregarded Cot,\nThe brawling Brook, and the wide Alder-bough,\nThe ozier Canopy, and plumy choir,\nHymning the Morn's return, than the rich Dome\nOf gilded Palaces ! and sweeter far--\nO! far more graceful ! far more exquisite,\nThe Widow's tear bathing the living rose,\nThan the rich ruby, blushing on the breast,\nOf guilty greatness. Welcome then to me--\nThe WIDOW'S LOWLY HOME : The Soldier's HEIR;\nThe proud inheritor of Heav'n's best gifts--\nThe mind unshackled--and the guiltless Soul!","uploadedOn":"12/4/2022,","url":"/users/@Robinson/posts/23","author":{"displayName":"Robinson","uniqueName":"@Robinson","uniqueId":8,"pfp":"/static/images/pfps/plate_egg.jpg","url":"/users/@Robinson","joinDate":"12/4/2022,","postCount":54,"banned":false,"admin":true,"badges":{"0":{"name":"Admin","icon":"fa-hammer","cssColor":"cyan","priority":100}},"_id":"HSXnE2Vu4Mfl2dGl","createdAt":{"$$date":1670171467439},"updatedAt":{"$$date":1670432161963}},"_id":"y3tP6WK0lxsnatuC","createdAt":{"$$date":1670171526559},"updatedAt":{"$$date":1670432162025}}
